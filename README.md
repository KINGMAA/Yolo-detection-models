## üìã Project Overview

## üîç What is Object Detection?
Object detection is a computer vision technique used to identify and locate objects within an image or video. Unlike image classification, object detection predicts both **what** objects are present and **where** they are located (bounding boxes).

### Key Components of Object Detection
- **Bounding Boxes:** Rectangles drawn around detected objects with coordinates for position and size.
- **Confidence Score:** A probability indicating how certain the model is about the detected object.
- **Class Label:** The category to which the detected object belongs.

## üß† Introduction to YOLO (You Only Look Once)
YOLO is a family of real-time object detection models designed for speed and accuracy. Unlike traditional methods that apply a sliding window or region proposal network, YOLO predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from an image in a single pass.

### Key Advantages of YOLO
‚úÖ **Fast Inference:** Ideal for real-time applications.
‚úÖ **End-to-End Prediction:** Simultaneously predicts class labels and bounding boxes.
‚úÖ **Versatile Architecture:** Suitable for various computer vision tasks.
